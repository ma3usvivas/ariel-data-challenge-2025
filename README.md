Kaggle Competition: Ariel Data Challenge 2025, Data Preprocessing and Modelling

This Repository is made of three parts:
 -- Data Preload, where the cameras of FGS1 and AIRS-CH0 are pre-procecessed for 

 -- Data Pre-Processing, where all the data from the given wavelengths are pre-processed and some features like transit depth and SNR are extracted

 -- Data Modelling, where the pre-processed data is modelled to give the best GLL (Gaussian Log-Likelihood result
